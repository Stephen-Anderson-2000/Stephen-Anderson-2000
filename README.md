### Howdy
I'm a student in my final year of studying Computer Science at Nottingham Trent University.

- I’m currently working on nothing in particular outside of university coursework
- I’m currently learning Java for Android as part of my final year project
- I am also looking into ways of using machine learning and GPS data for path recognition
- How to reach me: stephen.anderson0220@gmail.com

### FYP
For my final year project (supervised by Dr Mufti Mahmud) I am investigating ways to assist those living with dementia using analysis methods of GPS data in a Java application for Android, extending an idea given to my group last year by my supervisor
