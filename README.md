### Personal projects
I often attempt the Advent of Code challenge, and some of my partial attempts can be found here in a variety of languages

### FYP
For my final year project (supervised by Dr Mufti Mahmud) I investigated ways to assist those living with dementia using analysis methods of GPS data in a Java application for Android, extending an idea given to my group in second year by my supervisor
